# RK4 Rocket Trajectory Simulation

This project models the trajectory of a rocket under the effects of gravity and atmospheric drag using the classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method.
## Project Features

- Models rocket thrust phase with mass loss over time, as well as burnout
- Includes atmospheric drag with altitude-dependent air density.
- Performs convergence study showing fourth-order accuracy of RK4.
- Compares rocket trajectories with and without atmospheric drag.
